<h2><a name=about>What is "KSame"?</a></h2>
KSame is a simple game. It's played by one player, so there is only one winner :-) You play
for fun and against the highscore. It has been inspired by SameGame, that is only famous on
the Macintosh plattform. <P>
Last year Stephan Kulow and I wrote "Probiere" (a german pun) and it was our first attempt 
to write a X11 application. We decided that it would be a good idea to port it to KDE and I've done it 
with some help of Stephan.

<H2><a name=rules>How to play the game</a> </h2>

You can erase same pieces which are connected vertical or horizontal, as you click them. If
there are pieces over the erased pieces, they will drop down. If all pieces on the vertical line
are erased, all pieces on the right side will slide left. 
<P>
The score is ([the number of erased pieces] - 2) ^ 2. Therefore, connect same pieces as more
as you can, and erase them at a time, so that you can aim the higher score. 
The game is over when there are no pieces to be erased. 
<P>
The score will be decreased as the number of remained pieces. If you erase all pieces, the
bonus points (1000pts.) will be added to the score.  

<H2><a name=strategy>Strategy hints</a></h2>
Collect as many pieces as possible. In the beginning pick one color and delete it, perhaps this
will make the other areas bigger.
