KAsteroids
----------

You know this game.  Its in its very early stages (4 days work so far :-)
so don't expect too much.  It is based on Warwick Allison's QwSpriteField
widget.

From the top level directory do:
  ./configure
  cd kasteroids/QwSpriteField
  make
  cd ..
  make

and run from the kasteroids directory.  It CANNOT be installed yet!!!

If I could get these Makefile.in things working properly, you could just
do ./configure; make, but I haven't had much luck.
