<h2><a name=about>What is "Abalone"?</a></h2>
Abalone is a simple board strategy game. It's played by two players. 
There are red and yellow types of pieces for the different players.
Beginning from a start position where each player has 14 pieces,
moves are drawn till one player has pushed 6 pieces of his opponent out 
of the board.

<H2><a name=rules>The Rules for Abalone</a></H2>

1. Red always moves first. <p>

2. Two types of moves are allowed:

<ul>
<li> Normal <br>
One, two or three pieces of yours in a row can be moved be one in the 6
directions. Side moves are allowed too. <p>

Press a mouse button on the first
of the pieces you want to move. The piece will be highlighted. Now drag the
mouse in the wished direction. If the move is valid, the cursor will change
to a arrow in that direction and all the pieces of the move are highlighted.
If that's the move you want to draw release the mouse button. <p>

Side moves are handled another way: For two adjacent pieces click between
them and drag; for three pieces press the middle mouse button on the middle
piece - if a side move is allowed for the pieces they all are highlighted.
Otherwise only the middle one is highlighted and you draw a normal move.

<li> Pushing <br>
You can push a maximum of two pieces of the opponent in front of your own
pieces as long as the number of the drawn pieces of yours is greater than
that of the opponent pieces. That means with three own pieces you can
push one or two of the opponent and with two pieces one. <p>

Special pushing moves are those which push a piece of the opponent out of
the board. If you have drawn 6 of those moves you have won. <p>

</ul>

If you still don't know what's all about, look at a game where the computer
plays both sides. After executing KAbalone, select Options/Computer plays/Both
and start a new game.

<h2><a name=author>About KAbalone</a></h2>
"kabalone" is part of the <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE (Kool Desktop
Environment)</a> project. It was written in September 1997 by
<a href="mailto:weidendo@informatik.tu-muenchen.de">Josef Weidendorfer</a>.
Don't hesitate to contact me if you find bugs or if you have 
questions/suggestions on the implementation (... my 
<a href="www.student.uni-augsburg.de/weidendo~/">homepage</a>).
The program is
published under the GNU GPL. <p>

The original program was developed in 1993 for DOS and pure Xlib. For KDE
there was a major rewrite.<p>

Notice: The game idea is not by me. It's a real board game vendored by a
German game producing firm (I think).
