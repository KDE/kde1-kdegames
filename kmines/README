 - updating of Makefile (use KDEDIR)
 - use kmsgbox
 
0.62
 - use KKeyCode to manage some keyboard shortcuts

0.6
 - change the class name "Status" to "KStatus" as an include file present on my
   system defines something called "Status"...

0.5

 - better look of option & highscores windows

0.4

0.3
 - the random configuration seems to be a bit too repetitive ...
   (fixed : silly me !)
 - a red cross must show where the marked cases have not contained mines
 - uncover case on button release, not on button push and also allow moving
   the mouse with the left button pressed
 - clear function with the mid-button : it should be kool :)
 - a pause entry in the menu
 - QLCD for timer and mines left
 - cleaning of the highscore stuff (the highscore file is now in the home dir)
 - option : "'?' mark" on/off (the default behaviour is on : you can change
   it by editing the defines.h file)

	
0.2
 - some code reorganisation
 - timer starts at first click now
 - it is no more possible to click on a marked or uncertain case now
 - a small help
 - colored pixmaps
 - a better look (?)
