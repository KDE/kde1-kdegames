    <h1>KSmiletris User Manual</h1>

    <p>KSmiletris is a Tetris-like game written for the K Desktop Environment
      using the QT and KDE libraries. It has been tested under the
      Beta 4 release of KDE and should be considered stable.
    <p>I release it under an <i>open source code</i> license.  If you like
      this program, send me a postcard from your hometown <b>:-)</b>.

    <h1>How to play</h1>

    The only keys you need to use are the four arrow keys plus the space bar.
    The objective of the game is to control and to place the
    falling blocks, so that two blocks vertically have matching
    patterns.  This sequence and the blocks behind are then removed,
    and the above blocks will fall down.

    <h1>Where to find the sources</h1>

    The main FTP site is
    <a href="ftp://ftp.vix.com/guests/ssigala/pub/">ftp.vix.com</a>,
    where you can find the latest sources of this program plus the sources
    of other programs written by me.
    The other available FTP site is
    <a href="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">ftp.kde.org</a>,
    the main KDE FTP site, or any other mirror.
