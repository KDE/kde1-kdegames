Another kool game for KDE :)

KAbalone is a game like Reversi. You play against the computer on a
board. For rules look at the HTML manual.

INSTALLATION:
If you find this directory (and README) in kdeapps, there is nothing
to do. By installing the kdeapps package KAbalone should be installed too.

Otherwise get the kdeapps package and unpack it.
Make the kabalone/ directory (with this README) a subdirectory of
kdeapps/ and add "kabalone" to the SUBDIRS variable in the toplevel
Makefile.in of the kdeapps package. By installing the package kdeapps now
KAbalone should be installed too.

Have fun...
...and remember: Your computer already is a real thinking machine !
