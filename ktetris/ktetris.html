<h1>KDE tetris</h1>


This program is a clone of the well-known game Tetris.

You must fit the falling pieces (by rotations and translations) to form full 
lines. Every full lines are
destroyed what releases some fresh space. Be aware that destroying many lines
at the same time gives more points. A four-lines destruction is called a
"tetris" : it is maximum amount of points.
<P>
Actually the multiplayer option is in alpha stage. So expect it to be buggy.
You can play with 2 or more players. When destroying a line, a player sends
some crap at the bottom of his neighbour's game :)
<P>
NB : Most of the core code has been written by Eirik Eng (see the file
README.original) as an example for the Qt distribution.

</UL> <P> Now enjoy yourself !
