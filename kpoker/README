This is release 0.4.1 of KPoker, a simple video poker clone for the 
KDE desktop environment <http://www.kde.org>. 

This is an cvs-only release and therefore you can only get it with the game
distribution from  <http://www.kde.org>

As the version number indicates everything is pretty much beta
right now. Please take a look at the file CHANGES to see what 
was changed recently 



Have fun with the game and please report any problems / bugs suggestions.
