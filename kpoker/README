This is release 0.2 of KPoker, a simple video poker clone for the 
KDE desktop environment <http://www.kde.org>. 

Latest versions of KPoker are avaible at the KPoker homepage
<http://www.mabi.de/~whynot/kpoker.html> and at <http://www.kde.org>

As the version number indicates everything is pretty much alpha
right now, although some stuff has been fixed already. Please take a
look at the file CHANGES to see what was changed recently 


Have fun with the game and please report any bugs you find....
