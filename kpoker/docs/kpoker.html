<LI><A NAME="gameplay"><STRONG>How do I play ?</STRONG></LI>
<P>
At the beginning of the game you get $100. You draw five cards and
decide which ones you want to keep. After doing this you draw new
cards for those you did not want to keep. The game now looks if you
got any <A HREF="#hands">poker hand</A> and gives cash
according to the kind of hand you got (see <A HREF="#scoring">scoring</A>). Now you start
over, drawing five cards, deciding which ones you want to keep ...
<BR>
The game ends if you can't pay for another round anymore or if you close the kpoker window.
