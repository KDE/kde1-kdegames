Hello,

this is the first release of ksnake, a KDE snake game.
ksnake was inspired by a windows game called RattlerRace.



BUGS:
	-in this release the game is not yet resizeable.

TODO:
	-lots of code fixes
	-make it resizeable
	-write a help file
	-widget to configure the background pixmaps or a plain color like in Kreversi

It is easy to create your own levels, just copy one of the levels to ~/.kde/ksnake
and edit it.

hope you will enjoy this game.
michel
